        Welcome to GriNd-O-TRoN, a game designed to emulate the combat portions
        of older Japanese-style Role Playing Games, like Dragon Quest/Warrior 
        or Final Fantasy. GriNd-O-TRoN strips out the often convoluted
        story, and just gives you the battles. In GriNd-O-TRoN the
        action is turn based - you make a move, then you wait for your
        opponent to make their move, and you continue trading turns until
        victory or defeat.  After each battle, experience points
        are awarded, and when accumulated in sufficient quantity, the player
        character gains a level and becomes more powerful. This cycle,
        fighting battles over and over again to become more powerful, is
        known as grinding, and is where the name comes from.
